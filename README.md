---

## Getting started

1. ### Visit the extension store for **[chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)** or **[firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/)**

2. ### Open the extension popup page

3. ### Set your preferred activation shortcut (default: Ctrl+Space)

4. ### Pick 2 **unique** sets for the combinations to be displayed in each tabbable element on the page (ex: ABCDEF, 12345 -> A1, A2 ... AA1 ... 5F5). The total combinations are equal to set1 x set2 x (set1 + set2) (ex above: 6 x 5 x 11 = 330). From experience while developing, a good amount of combinations is around 250-350. (default: A..Z, 0..9). Make sure the sets are convieniently set for you to type. **Note** the sets are case insensitive and all characters are converted to uppercase

5. ### You are done! Start navigating the web with your keyboard

TODO
1  ✅ Fixed pixel size bubbles
2  ✅ Fix bubble positioning over element
3  ✅ Rotate the ones near the edges
4  ✅ Fix weird activation glitches
5  ✅ Figure out what to do in case of custom elements like the ones on youtube -> leave it to tabIndex
6  ✅ Fix rare & weird misplacement of bubbles (found @google search result links)
        This can happen when the element has another element inside it that registers another DOMRect (Element as such is <br>)
7  ✅ Fix input auto focusing when bubbles are active (found @bing search input...)
8  ✅ Figure out how to make the bubble background be readable on any background
9  ☑️ Once finished with chromium make it work on firefox (Anyone reading this, it'll probably be the last thing I do)
10 ✅ User preference to auto close after a combination is pressed
11 ☑️ User preference to pick color for the bubbles
12 ❔ Script.js is loaded once! Need to fix how it handles the state. (Weird behavior, fixed for now)
13 ✅ Visually show what the key combination the user is pressing when the bubbles are active
14 ✅ Remove bubbles on scroll because they have a fixed position and it site looks ugly afterwards
       ✅ 14.1 FIX: Feature brakes the bubbles when used in Bing. Still the search bar autofocuses....
15 ✅ Update the bubbles when active whenever the mutation observer is fired
        15.1 ✅ Reset the focused bubble when an update happens
        15.2 ❌ Instead of a full update, just update the bubbles that are affected by the mutation
16 ✅ Focus on the ext-bubble-container when the shortcut is pressed to stop any input from collecting the keypresses

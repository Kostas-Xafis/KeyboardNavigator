TODO
1 ✅ Fixed pixel size bubbles
2 ✅ Fix bubble positioning over element
3 ✅ Rotate the ones near the edges
4 ✅ Fix weird activation glitches
5 ✅ Figure out what to do in case of custom elements like the ones on youtube -> leave it to tabIndex
6 ✅ Fix rare & weird misplacement of bubbles (found @google search result links)
        Turns out it has to do with the fact that tabbable element contains more than one DOMRects (when calling getClientRects())
        Element as such is <br>
7 ✅ Fix input auto focusing when bubbles are active (found @bing search input...)
8 ✅ Figure out how to make the bubble background be readable on any background
9 ☑️ Once finished with chromium make it work on firefox
10 ✅ User preference to auto close after a combination is pressed
11 ☑️ User preference to pick color for the bubbles

TODO
1  ✅ FIX : Pixel size bubbles
2  ✅ FIX : Bubble positioning over element
3  ✅ FEAT: Rotate the ones near the edges
4  ✅ FIX : Weird activation glitches
5  ✅ FEAT: Figure out what to do in case of custom elements like the ones on youtube -> leave it to tabIndex
6  ✅ FIX : Rare & weird misplacement of bubbles (found @google search result links)
                This can happen when the element has another element inside it that registers another DOMRect (Element as such is <br>)
7  ✅ FIX : Input auto focusing when bubbles are active (found @bing search input...)
8  ✅ FIX : Figure out how to make the bubble background be readable on any background
9  ☑️ FEAT: Once finished with chromium make it work on firefox (Anyone reading this, it'll probably be the last thing I do)
10 ✅ FEAT: User preference to auto close after a combination is pressed
11 ✅ FEAT: User preference to pick color for the bubbles
12 ✅ FIX : DOM cache keeps the bubbles even after the page is changed (found @github and many more probably)!
13 ✅ FEAT: Visually show what the key combination the user is pressing when the bubbles are active
14 ✅ FIX : Remove bubbles on scroll because they have a fixed position and it site looks ugly afterwards
       ✅ 14.1 FIX: Feature brakes the bubbles when used in Bing. Still the search bar autofocuses....
15 ✅ FEAT: Update the bubbles when active whenever the mutation observer is fired
        15.1 ✅ Reset the focused bubble when an update happens
        15.2 ❌ Instead of a full update, just update the bubbles that are affected by the mutation
        15.3 ✅ Applied a more effective way by updating the bubbles after the dom has been updated
16 ✅ FIX : Focus on the ext-bubble-container when the shortcut is pressed to stop any input from collecting the keypresses
17 ✅ FIX : Remaining selected bubble is not removed after a dom update
18 ✅ FIX : Focused input losses focus when the bubbles are removed
19 ✅ FEAT: User preference to pick the font size of the bubbles
20 ✅ FEAT: Create 2 separate "pages" for shortcuts and style preferences
